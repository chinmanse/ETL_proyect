A few years later, Alan Turing and others built on his work, showing that mathematics is riddled with \u201cundecidable\u201d statements\u2014problems that cannot be solved by any computer algorithm.", "These results demonstrated that there are fundamental limits to what proof and computation are capable of. Some mathematics can simply never be known.", "Hilbert\u2019s dream was dead. But it lived on in fragments.

Both groups have proved that, for ", " beyond integers, there is ", " to determine if any given Diophantine equation has a solution. The work not only allows mathematicians to get a more precise view of what they can and cannot know but gives them an entirely new level of control over one of the most central objects in mathematics.", "The new proofs focused on a natural extension of Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem. The extension deals with Diophantine equations whose solutions belong to number systems that are close relatives of the integers.", "If you start with the numbers 1 and \u22121, you can add them in different combinations to get every other integer. But say you start with a different finite set of numbers\u2014like 1, \u22121 and \u221a2. You can add those numbers in different combinations to get a new number system, called a ring of integers (so named even though the ring need not contain only integers). Other rings of integers can be built out of sets of numbers that include, say, the square root of \u22121 (the imaginary number that mathematicians call ", ")", " or the cube root of 2. Is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a given Diophantine equation has solutions that fall in one of these rings of integers?", "Carlo Pagano of Concordia University recently used his expertise on elliptic curves to resolve a major conjecture in number theory.", "Mathematicians suspected that, for every single ring of integers\u2014that is, infinitely many systems of numbers\u2014the problem is still undecidable.

In work that began with Julia Robinson and others around 1950 and culminated in Matiyasevich\u2019s 1970 result, it was shown that for every Turing machine, there is a corresponding Diophantine equation. \u201cIt was completely unexpected,\u201d said ", " of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. \u201cDiophantine equations over the integers are enough to define, basically, anything you can imagine.\u201d", "Moreover, the mathematicians set up this elegant correspondence so that if a Turing machine halted for a given input, its corresponding Diophantine equation would have an integer solution. If the Turing machine ran forever, its corresponding Diophantine equation would have no solution. But this meant that Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem encoded the halting problem: An algorithm that could sort Diophantine equations based on whether or not they had integer solutions would also be able to sort Turing machines based on whether or not they halted.", "In other words, Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem is undecidable.", "Mathematicians hoped to follow the same approach to prove the extended, rings-of-integers version of the problem\u2014but they hit a snag.", "The useful correspondence between Turing machines and Diophantine equations falls apart when the equations are allowed to have non-integer solutions. For instance, consider again the equation ", " = ", ". If you\u2019re working in a ring of integers that includes \u221a2, then you\u2019ll end up with some new solutions, such as ", " = \u221a2, ", " = 2. The equation no longer corresponds to a Turing machine that computes perfect squares\u2014and, more generally, the Diophantine equations can no longer encode the halting problem.", "But in 1988, a graduate student at New York University named ", " started to play with ideas for how to get around this problem. By 2000, she and others had formulated a plan. Say you were to add a bunch of extra terms to an equation like ", " = ", " that magically forced ", " to be an integer again, even in a different number system. Then you could salvage the correspondence to a Turing machine. Could the same be done for all Diophantine equations? If so, it would mean that Hilbert\u2019s problem could encode the halting problem in the new number system.", "Over the years, Shlapentokh and other mathematicians figured out what terms they had to add to the Diophantine equations for various kinds of rings, which allowed them to demonstrate that Hilbert\u2019s problem was still undecidable in those settings. They then boiled down all remaining rings of integers to one case: rings that involve the imaginary number ", ". Mathematicians realized that in this case, the terms they\u2019d have to add could be determined using a special equation called an elliptic curve.", "But the elliptic curve would have to satisfy two properties. First, it would need to have infinitely many solutions. Second, if you switched to a different ring of integers\u2014if you removed the imaginary number from your number system\u2014then all the solutions to the elliptic curve would have to maintain the same underlying structure.", "As it turned out, building such an elliptic curve that worked for every remaining ring was an extremely subtle and difficult task. But Koymans and Pagano\u2014experts on elliptic curves who had worked closely together since they were in graduate school\u2014had just the right tool set to try.", "Since his time as an undergraduate, Koymans had been thinking about Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem. Throughout graduate school, and throughout his collaboration with Pagano, it beckoned. \u201cI spent a few days every year thinking about it and getting horribly stuck,\u201d Koymans said. \u201cI\u2019d try three things and they\u2019d all blow up in my face.\u201d", "In 2022, while at a conference in Banff, Canada, he and Pagano ended up chatting about the problem. They hoped that together, they could build the special elliptic curve needed to resolve the problem. After finishing some other projects, they got to work.", "Peter Koymans, a mathematician at Utrecht University, has been thinking about Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem since he was an undergraduate.", "They started with a simple equation for an elliptic curve that didn\u2019t satisfy either of the required properties. They knew they could use a well-established technique called a quadratic twist\u2014something they\u2019d been studying for the better part of a decade\u2014to tweak the equation so that it would meet the first condition. They simply had to multiply one of the equation\u2019s variables by a specific number, and they\u2019d get a new elliptic curve with infinitely many solutions.", "But this left them with a problem. They had no way to guarantee that this new curve satisfied the second property\u2014that its solutions would look similar for rings that differed by an imaginary number. The mathematicians needed to get better control over the quadratic twist.", "They got stuck. \u201cI had this dark feeling,\u201d Koymans said. \u201cI started to get suspicious that we were missing something.\u201d", "Then, in summer 2024, while working on a different problem, the pair had to use quadratic twists again. One night, in the middle of this research, Koymans found himself lying awake, unable to stop thinking about Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem.", "That other work, Koymans realized, gave them an important hint, one of those strange and surprising mathematical concordances that sometimes appear: If the number they used in the quadratic twist was the product of exactly three prime numbers, then they\u2019d get the control they needed to guarantee the second property. But because their elliptic curve had to be constructed so carefully and meet so many specifications, there were lots of additional constraints on what those three primes could be. Could Koymans and Pagano find ones that worked\u2014no matter which ring they were using?", "Pagano happened to have planned a visit to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, where Koymans was working at the time, a few days later. They spent the next week struggling at the blackboard together, trying to find primes that would meet all the constraints. Finally, they figured out that they had to use four primes, rather than three, to construct their quadratic twist. This allowed them to apply a method from an entirely separate area of math, called additive combinatorics, to ensure that the right combination of primes existed for every ring.", "That was the final piece: They\u2019d built their elliptic curve. It gave them the recipe they needed to add terms to their Diophantine equations, which then enabled them to encode Turing machines\u2014and the halting problem\u2014in those equations, regardless of what number system they used. It was settled. Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem is undecidable for every ring of integers.", "The result was solidified further last Thursday, when, less than two months after Koymans and Pagano posted their paper online, an independent team of four mathematicians announced a ", ". Instead of looking for a special elliptic curve, they had relied on a different kind of equation to do the same job.", "Both groups hope to use their techniques\u2014which give them unprecedented control over elliptic curves and related equations\u2014to make progress on other problems as well. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that the two methods could be used together to do even more,\u201d said ", ", a mathematician at Princeton University and one of the authors of the second proof.", "Meanwhile, the search for where undecidability ends and decidability begins is not over: Mathematicians are continuing to explore Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem in new settings.", "This is just one of many questions, according to ", " of the University of Montreal, that \u201creflect the philosophical side of what in the world is true.\u201d", "All knowledge has limits. \u201cIt reminds us there are things that are just not doable,\u201d Granville said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what you are.\u201d", " ", " ", " "]}
