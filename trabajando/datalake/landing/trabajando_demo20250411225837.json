CEO Anne Wojcicki, who cofounded the company in 2006, has also stepped down after months of ", " to take the firm private.", "As ", " about the company\u2019s future reaches its peak, all eyes are on the trove of deeply personal\u2014and potentially valuable\u2014genetic data that 23andMe holds. Privacy advocates have long warned that the risk of entrusting genetic data to any institution is twofold\u2014the organization could fail to protect it, but it could also hand over customer data to a new entity that they may not trust and didn\u2019t choose.", "California attorney general Rob Bonta reminded consumers in ", " on Friday that Californians have a legal right to ask that an organization delete their data. 23andMe customers in other states and countries largely do not have the same protections, though there is also a right to deletion for health data in Washington state\u2019s My Health My Data Act and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Regardless of residency, all 23andMe customers should consider downloading anything they want to keep from the service and should then attempt to delete their information.", "\u201cThis situation really brings home the point that there is still no national health privacy law in the US protecting your rights unless you live in California or Washington,\u201d says Andrea Downing, an independent security researcher and cofounder of the patient-led digital rights nonprofit The Light Collective. \u201cMeanwhile, we continue to evolve our understanding of how genetic information has value, but also has unique vulnerability.\u201d", "John Verdi, senior vice president of policy at the Future of Privacy Forum, says 23andMe\u2019s new owner could revise the company\u2019s privacy policies for new customers and new data collection, but the data it has already collected from current customers is subject to existing terms. \u201cThe company has legal obligations regarding information collected under the current policies,\u201d he says.", "Still, researchers emphasize that in practice, such a large transition will create real data exposure that is outside of 23andMe customers\u2019 control. \u201cIn my opinion, these privacy policies\u2014especially in the context of acquisitions in the venture capital and private equity space\u2014aren't worth the paper they're printed on,\u201d says longtime security researcher and data privacy advocate Kenn White. \u201cFor regular people out there who use these services, you're pretty much on your own. My advice is to request your data get deleted as soon as possible\"", "To delete your genetic data through 23andMe\u2019s website, log in and then go to ", " in your profile.

Once you initiate the process, you\u2019ll receive an email from 23andMe to confirm. Click the link in the email to complete the deletion process.
