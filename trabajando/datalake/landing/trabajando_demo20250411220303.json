What is it with this crazy, crucial number?", "date_published": "2025-03-14T07:00:00-04:00", "author": "Rhett Allain", "segments": [" We celebrate pi on March 14 because 3-14 gives the first three digits of this famous number. But what\u2019s the big deal about pi anyway? Why does it get a day? Well, for starters, it ", " the simplest, most perfect shape, the circle. So it\u2019s everywhere around you. Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle: ", " = C/d.", "No matter how big or small a circle is, that ratio is always the same. In decimal notation, it\u2019s 3.141592653 \u2026 aaand you can run that out as far as you want, because it\u2019s an irrational number, and it never, ever, ", " ends.", "What people do\u2014in fact what calculators do if you press the ", " button\u2014is choose a certain number of decimal places, depending on the precision required, and round off to that number. It\u2019s not really pi, but you could say \u2026 it\u2019s a ", " of pi. (Sorry, but every Pi Day story needs a pi pun.)", "Being infinitely long doesn\u2019t in itself make a number irrational. For example, say you have a rectangle that measures 4 by 11 meters. The ratio of the sides, 4/11, equals 0.36363636 \u2026 This number is also endless, but it follows a pattern. With irrational numbers, there\u2019s ", ".", "The real distinction is that ", " numbers can be written as a ratio of two integers. (Get it? ratio-nal.) And ratios are the same thing as fractions. So:", "It\u2019s also the case that any finite decimal number, no matter how long, can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. (Which is pretty mind-boggling all by itself.) Irrational numbers, on the other hand, ", ".", "Oh, you can ", ". For example, 22/7 is a pretty good approximation. But it's not pi. (We could have celebrated Pi Day on July 22, since most of the world uses the day-month-year format for dates, and that would be 22-7.)", "But maybe you\u2019re not inclined to take my word for it. So here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to use a brute-force algorithm I made in Python to generate all possible integer fractions and see if one of them equals pi.", "What\u2019s a brute-force method? It\u2019s a way of solving a problem that doesn't require cleverness, just a ton of work. My program starts with the fraction 1/1 and methodically ratchets it up by adding 1 to the numerator or the denominator. Here's the recipe:", "- Take the fraction (u/v) and compare to pi", "- If u/v is less than pi, add one to the numerator (u+1)", "- If u/v is greater than pi, add one to the denominator (v+1)", "- If u/v is ", " to pi, you win. You just proved that pi is rational.", "So the series starts like this: 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 7/3, 8/3 \u2026 I mean, you could do this on paper, but you\u2019d soon go mad. I ran my program to iterate 1,000 times. (If you want to see the code, ", ".) Then I plotted the decimal value for all 1,000 fractions (Since the horizontal axis goes from 1 to 1,000, I'm using a log scale to compress it.)", "After 1,000 runs, I have a fraction of 760/242. This is a fine value for pi. It's accurate to two decimal places\u2014the standard 3.14, which is what a lot of people use anyway. But it's not pi. Oh, well, how about 500,000 iterations?", "This gives me a final fraction of:", "This integer ratio is close\u2014it matches pi up to the sixth decimal place\u2014but it\u2019s ", " not pi. OK, how about 10 million iterations? This gives an integer fraction of 7,585,471 over 2,414,531, which is off by only 0.00003 percent. But it's still NOT PI.", "So, what have we done here? Not much really. We didn't ", " that pi is irrational, but I think any rational person would be inclined to accept it at this point.", "How about a visual demo? We can actually show that pi is irrational by swinging balls around in a circle. Here\u2019s how it works: First we start with a single ball moving at a constant speed.", "Now let\u2019s add another ball on the end of that ball. It\u2019s moving in a circle with the same radius, but at a speed that is 3.5 times faster. Not only does this create a cool pattern, but at some point the pattern will repeat. If you keep your eye on the starting point on the right side, you can see when the ball begins to retrace its path:", "You could try any ratio of speeds that evaluates to a finite decimal number, like the 3.5 above. In other words, rational numbers! 3.5 can be expressed as an integer fraction: 7/2. Each one will give you a different pattern, but for all rational numbers the pattern will eventually repeat.", "So what happens when you use an irrational number for the speed? In the one below, I have the second ball moving at ", " times the speed of the first one:", "See? The pattern ", ". It\u2019s just like the never-ending series of digits in pi. It gets close, but it\u2019s still off by a little bit\u2014you can see the lines begin to thicken. In fact, I let it run for a long time and this is what I got:", "Because you can't write pi as a fraction of integers, the two circles will never sync back up. It's a cool way to show that pi is irrational, but it's also just fun to watch."]}
