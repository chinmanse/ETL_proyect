But two years later, when he finally set aside time to go through the paper (‚Äújust for fun,‚Äù as he put it), his efforts would lead to a rethinking of a widely used tool in computer science.",

      ",‚Äù referred to arrowlike entities that can direct you to a piece of information, or element, in a computer‚Äôs memory. Krapivin soon came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory. However, to achieve that, he needed a better way of organizing the data that the pointers would point to.",
      "He turned to a common approach for storing data known as a hash table. But in the midst of his tinkering, Krapivin realized that he had invented a new kind of hash table, one that worked faster than expected‚Äîtaking less time and fewer steps to find specific elements.",
      ", a coauthor of the ‚ÄúTiny Pointers‚Äù paper and Krapivin‚Äôs former professor at Rutgers, was initially skeptical of Krapivin‚Äôs new design. Hash tables are among the most thoroughly studied data structures in all of computer science; the advance sounded too good to be true. But just to be sure, he asked a frequent collaborator (and a ‚ÄúTiny Pointers‚Äù coauthor), ",
      " of Carnegie Mellon University, to check out his student‚Äôs invention. Kuszmaul had a different reaction. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt just come up with a cool hash table,‚Äù he remembers telling Krapivin. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve actually completely wiped out a 40-year-old conjecture!‚Äù",
      "Without setting out to do so, Andrew Krapivin upended the common thinking around hash tables‚Äîone of the best-studied tools in computer science.",

      "Hash tables have become ubiquitous in computing, partly because of their simplicity and ease of use. They‚Äôre designed to allow users to do exactly three things: ‚Äúquery‚Äù (search for) an element, delete an element, or insert one into an empty slot. The first hash tables date back to the early 1950s, and computer scientists have studied and used them ever since. Among other things, researchers wanted to figure out the speed limits for some of these operations. How fast, for example, could a new search or insertion possibly be?",
      "Mart√≠n Farach-Colton helped Krapivin prove that his new hash table contradicted a long-standing conjecture.",
      "The answer generally depends on the amount of time it takes to find an empty spot in a hash table. This, in turn, typically depends on how full the hash table is. Fullness can be described in terms of an overall percentage‚Äîthis table is 50 percent full, that one‚Äôs 90 percent‚Äîbut researchers often deal with much fuller tables. So instead, they may use a whole number, denoted by ",

      " is 100, then the table is 99 percent full. If ",
      " is 1,000, the table is 99.9 percent full. This measure of fullness offers a convenient way to evaluate how long it should take to perform actions like queries or insertions.",
      "Researchers have long known that for certain common hash tables, the expected time required to make the worst possible insertion‚Äîputting an item into, say, the last remaining open spot‚Äîis proportional to ",
      ". ‚ÄúIf your hash table is 99 percent full,‚Äù Kuszmaul said, ‚Äúit makes sense that you would have to look at around 100 different positions to find a free slot.‚Äù",

He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you‚Äôre searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than ",
      ". For 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao‚Äôs conjecture was true.",
      "Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. ‚ÄúI did this without knowing about Yao‚Äôs conjecture,‚Äù he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table‚Äîone that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log ",

      "You could try any ratio of speeds that evaluates to a finite decimal number, like the 3.5 above. In other words, rational numbers! 3.5 can be expressed as an integer fraction: 7/2. Each one will give you a different pattern, but for all rational numbers the pattern will eventually repeat.",

Hudicka says that allowing shipping containers to sit uninspected could also impact other sectors, as the delays will prevent them from being reused for other kinds of goods. ‚ÄúThose containers are supposed to be moving stuff every day, and now they‚Äôre just parked somewhere,‚Äù he says.",

The disease is highly contagious and can be dangerous in babies, young children, and even adults. The measles virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can linger for up to two hours in an airspace.",
      "‚ÄúNo matter how healthy you are at baseline, it very efficiently enters the body through the upper airway,‚Äù says Glenn Fennelly, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and assistant vice president for global health at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso.",
      "In the lungs, the virus enters a type of white blood cell called alveolar macrophages, which transport pathogens to the lymph nodes. Typically, the lymph nodes act as a drainage system, removing foreign substances. But when the measles virus gets shuttled to lymph tissue, the virus attacks and destroys an important part of the immune system called memory cells. These memory cells remember prior infections and help the body fight pathogens it‚Äôs encountered before. When memory cells get wiped out, it leaves an individual more susceptible to future infections.",
      "The phenomenon is known as immune amnesia, and it can leave people vulnerable to other infections for several weeks to months. Research has shown that it can take ",
      " after a measles infection for protective immunity to fully return.",
      "‚ÄúThe measles virus is strongly immunosuppressive, meaning that it will interfere with the normal function of many white cells in the body that fight against other infections,‚Äù Fennelly says.",
      "One of those infections is bacterial pneumonia, which causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. About one in five people who get sick with measles in the US is hospitalized, and one in 20 will develop pneumonia. In some cases, patients may need supplemental oxygen or intubation and ventilator support.",

      "Measles can also cause a severe complication called encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Encephalitis can happen during an infection if the virus travels to the brain, or after an infection if the brain becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response. About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis. The condition can cause convulsions and in rare cases, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect against these complications. One dose of the vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses is 97 percent effective. The first dose is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months old, and the second dose is typically given between the ages of 4 and 6.",
      "There are no antiviral treatments available for measles, and while vitamin A is often given to people with an infection, it does not prevent measles or kill the virus. ‚ÄúThe infection itself can deplete levels of vitamin A in the body,‚Äù Bracho-Sanchez says. Both the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend two doses of vitamin A to children who are hospitalized with measles, since vitamin A deficiency can increase the risk of serious complications. However, large doses of vitamin A can be toxic.",

      "The reported number of US pets impacted by bird flu is relatively low, but cases of H5N1 in domestic cats are rising across the country. As of March 12, there have been 115 cases recorded in pet cats, across 20 states, ",
      ". However, many cases in pets are probably being missed. ‚ÄúWe are likely seeing an undercount of cases of H5 bird flu in pets, as not all sick pets with a possible epidemiologic link or exposure are reported to Veterinary Public Health,‚Äù says Jamie Middleton, director of veterinary public health and chief veterinarian at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. ‚ÄúAs a result, not all cases are tested.‚Äù",
      "Cost of testing is an additional barrier to getting an accurate picture of how widespread pet infections are. ‚ÄúCommercial PCR lab testing for influenza at veterinary clinics is very costly, approximately $200 to $300 for a respiratory PCR panel for dogs and cats,‚Äù Middleton says. ‚ÄúThus, many pet owners may elect to not test if their pet is experiencing respiratory symptoms.‚Äù",
      "Bird flu can also be missed during testing if an infected animal isn‚Äôt shedding the virus at the time they were tested, making it difficult to pinpoint just how widespread the virus is among pets.",
      "‚ÄúWe have known for years that cats are susceptible to influenza, and it‚Äôs on top of many people‚Äôs minds now because ",
      ",‚Äù says Sandra Faeh, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). Cats, specifically those that go outside, are particularly at risk because of their exposure to potentially sick birds.",
      "Cats are also becoming infected by being fed raw food‚Äîeither homemade or commercially available‚Äîas well as ",
      ". Two cats in ",
      " after having been fed raw food produced by the company Northwest Naturals. These deaths prompted a voluntary ",

      "Faeh says that the best thing to do to protect your cat is to keep them inside and away from wildlife. Middleton of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health also advises people to avoid ‚Äúfeeding raw or undercooked meat and poultry products, raw milk or raw dairy products, and raw pet food diets to their pets.‚Äù",
      "For cats who enjoy spending time outside, Feah says that leashed walks are a good option. She also encourages cat owners to consider constructing secure catios or enclosed and covered outdoor areas, to allow¬†the animals to still get fresh air and the sensory stimulation of being outside, but without the risk of contact with wildlife and their droppings.",
      "As there are concerns that bird flu could also be passed to dogs, Faeh recommends keeping dogs on a leash when outside as well. The AVMA also advises against feeding ",
      " or treats to dogs.",
      "Faeh says that cat owners should seek out veterinary attention if they have any concerns about their pet‚Äôs health. Symptoms of bird flu to watch for include loss of appetite, lethargy, fever, runny nose, runny eyes, and tremors. If you have a sick pet and are making a veterinary appointment, be sure to notify the clinic when scheduling that you are concerned about bird flu. Your veterinary team may ask you and your pet to wait outside until your appointment time, and may take additional precautions in-clinic to prevent possible spread of the disease.",
      "Keeping backyard chickens has become a popular hobby, including in large cities across the United States, and with the rising price of eggs it‚Äôs likely that more and more Americans are going to start keeping flocks. If they spend time outside, backyard flocks are at high risk of catching bird flu right now.",
      "For those considering becoming chicken owners, Faeh recommends first contacting the local health and agriculture departments to discuss the risks of bird flu in the local area, prior to bringing any chickens home. If the risk of infection is high where you live‚Äîfor instance if there have been reported outbreaks in flocks nearby‚Äîconsider delaying becoming an owner.",
      "If you‚Äôre still set on getting chickens, or if you already have a backyard flock, there are precautions you can take, Faeh says. Chickens should not be permitted to roam free in your yard, she says; instead, keep them in a covered coop or run to prevent exposure to wildlife. Faeh also encourages owners to limit their chickens‚Äô exposure to guests, who could unintentionally introduce the disease to the flock.",
      "Symptoms of H5N1 in backyard chickens can be more difficult to spot than in cats, as the birds can quickly die from the disease. It‚Äôs important to have established care with a local veterinarian who practices with chickens, Faeh says. If you notice any illness within your flock, contact your veterinarian right away. Likewise, if one of your chickens passes and you suspect bird flu, call your veterinarian and your local public health department.",
      "Owners should also take their own precautions when working with, caring for, and handling backyard chickens. Wash your hands and change your clothes after engaging with your birds, even if they seem in good health, Faeh says. If you have a pet or bird that appears sick, consider masking up, she adds.",
      "Although the spread of H5N1 from livestock to humans is rare, the virus has shown that it‚Äôs able to make this jump. Seventy people in the US have been infected since the beginning of the outbreak, and one person has died. Most human cases, however, have been reported in farm laborers working with infected livestock, with most of the transmission appearing to happen within the dairy industry, where people are encountering infected cattle and unpasteurized milk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to human health from H5N1 is low.",
      "But of course, the point of good hygiene is to try to stop the virus moving in either direction. If you handle sick chickens, you may not catch the virus, but you could pass it on. Washing your hands and changing clothes after spending time with your birds isn‚Äôt just for your benefit, but for the protection of other animals you might come into contact with‚Äîperhaps your pets, or those of people you know. ‚ÄúThe risks are much lower to people than cats,‚Äù says Faeh. ‚ÄúWe are more likely to bring it to them than they are to bring it to us.‚Äù"

      "More than 200 wildfires broke out in the southeastern US last week, marking an active start to the region‚Äôs annual fire season. A particularly large fire in a forest near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, forced dozens of evacuations and scorched more than 2,000 acres of land. Firefighters have largely contained the most severe blazes, but fire risk remains high in parts of the region.",
      "Severe wind and an unusually long period of dryness in the Southeast have made it easier for wildfires to ignite and spread. Meanwhile, a weather disaster that hit last year may be helping supply ample fuel to keep the flames raging. In September, Hurricane Helene tore through the Southeast, dumping more than a foot of rain in some locations and knocking over hundreds of thousands of acres of trees across the region.",
      "Now, these dried-out trees act as kindling and could block firefighters‚Äô access to the fires. This deadly combination of hurricane-fueled destruction and drought is expected to get worse as climate change accelerates, experts say.",
      "Though I‚Äôm normally based on the East Coast, I spent all of last week in Southern California reporting on the aftermath of the fires that decimated parts of Los Angeles County in January (more stories on this to come). Many people think of the West as the US fire epicenter, which is true in some ways. But purely by numbers, the Southeast has more wildfires than any other part of the country in a given year, ",
      ".",
      "These numerous and (mostly) small fires occur primarily in the spring and fall, with peak activity hitting between March and May. Fire is a natural part of ecosystems in the Southeast, often burning through weedy shrubs and enabling native plants to grow without as much competition. For people, most of the problems begin in what‚Äôs called the wildland-urban interface (WUI): A growing number of homeowners in the region live in extremely close proximity to forests and grasslands, where wildfires can easily encroach on property.",
      "And abnormally dry conditions, like the ones that most of the Carolinas have been experiencing since last fall, can pose heightened risks to WUI communities if a fire ignites.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not typical for conditions to be as dry as they have been the past couple of months,‚Äù Lauren Lowman, an associate professor in environmental engineering at Wake Forest University, told me. ‚ÄúAnything from a lightning strike to [a] power line sparking to someone deciding to burn leaves in their backyard and it just sort of getting out of control can lead to a wildfire under those conditions.‚Äù",
      "On Monday, police arrested a person for starting the Myrtle Beach fire by burning debris in her yard without taking necessary precautions to contain the fire, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission. As I ",
      ", droughts set up the ideal conditions for human-ignited fires to spread.",
      "Dozens of other fires broke out in Georgia and western North Carolina, which were both hard-hit by Hurricane Helene. In some areas, the fallen trees can act as fuel and promote fire spread in the short and long term, according to Virginia Iglesias, who studies the effects of climate variability on social-environmental systems at University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "‚ÄúAfter the hurricane, there were lots of dead trees felled on the ground, and that allows for sunlight to reach the ground,‚Äù Iglesias said. ‚ÄúAnd with that, it‚Äôs easier for biomass to desiccate, promoting fire if there‚Äôs an ignition. That‚Äôs in the short term. Another consequence of these fires is that they represent an access issue for firefighters. So there are lots of logs blocking roads.‚Äù",
      "This happened last week in North Carolina‚Äôs Polk County, where firefighters struggled to navigate between fallen trees and contain an almost 500-acre fire in the area, ",
      ". These fallen trees can be a fire nuisance for years after a hurricane, particularly in the Southeast, where dried out pine needles are highly combustible.",
      "For example, in 2018, Hurricane Michael decimated around 1.3 million acres of longleaf pine habitat in the Florida Panhandle, which ",
      " the Bertha Swamp Road Fire in 2022 that burned more than 33,000 acres.",
      "Some fire experts are also concerned that the extra sunlight on the landscape could trigger the growth of plants like rhododendron and mountain laurel in the southern Appalachians, which burn intensely if they catch fire.",
      "‚ÄúAnd now we‚Äôve got full sunlight on these areas that before didn‚Äôt get full sunlight,‚Äù Gary C. Wood, a retired North Carolina Forest Service worker who now coordinates wildfire management strategies for the Wildland Fire Leadership Council‚Äôs Southeast Region, ",
      ". ‚ÄúSo that stuff could really increase, growth-wise, and that‚Äôs gonna have a potential impact from a firefighting standpoint.‚Äù",
      "While a wide body of research clearly shows that climate change is fueling more intense fires out West, scientists are still fleshing out the direct climate connection for blazes in the Southeast. But some studies do show that warming is setting up conditions that wildfires thrive in throughout the region.",
      "‚ÄúDroughts are expected to become more intense and more frequent in the Southeast and many other areas of the country because of climate change,‚Äù Iglesias said. This could dramatically increase the amount of forest burned in the southern Appalachians, according to a ",
      ".",
      "To combat this, forest managers in this region often ignite planned, contained fires known as prescribed burns, which help clear out dry plants before they can fuel larger infernos. However, there are a few roadblocks to this strategy. More than 50 percent of the 751 million acres of forest land in the US is privately owned, and these owners decide how their land is managed. That means government agencies are required to get permission from homeowners before clearing downed trees following a storm or to allow prescribed burns on their land. There‚Äôs a growing push from some groups to help homeowners in North Carolina embrace this fire control strategy, ",
      ".",
      "Another snag is that climate change could reduce the number of days that land managers can practice prescribed burning in the Southeast, according to a ",
      ". Vegetation must be dry enough to ignite and burn, but temperatures and winds should be moderately low to prevent the fire from getting out of control‚Äîconditions that are becoming less predictable as global temperatures rise. Like wildfires, prescribed burns can also release air pollution, which can negatively affect air quality. My colleague Lee Hedgepeth ",
      ", which is currently happening in Birmingham, Alabama.",

      "In 2003, a German graduate student named ",
      " encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. But over the years, she was drawn back to it, again and again. Whenever she tried to focus on something else, she said, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt connect.‚Äù",
      "There was a risk that such a single-minded pursuit of so difficult a problem could hurt her academic career, but Sp√§th dedicated all her time to it anyway. It brought her to the office of ",
      ", a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris who, inspired by her efforts, became consumed by the conjecture, too. While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family.",
      "The problem that absorbed them takes a key theme in mathematics and turns it into a concrete tool for group theorists. Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety. But often, mathematicians have discovered, it‚Äôs enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties. In the third century BC, for instance, the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth‚Äîroughly 25,000 miles‚Äîby measuring shadows cast by the sun in just two cities about 500 miles apart. Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs. That can be enough to tell them what the function does for all possible inputs.",
      "The McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group‚Äî",
      " that can get prohibitively difficult to study‚Äîyou only need to look at a tiny piece of it.",
      "While working together on the McKay conjecture, Britta Sp√§th and Marc Cabanes fell in love and started a family.",
      "After the conjecture was posed in the 1970s, dozens of mathematicians tried their hand at proving it. They made partial progress‚Äîand in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system. But a full proof seemed out of reach.",
      "Then Sp√§th came along. Now, 20 years after she first learned about the problem and more than a decade after she met Cabanes, the two mathematicians have ",

      "The McKay conjecture began with the observation of a strange coincidence.",
      "John McKay‚Äî",
      " as ‚Äúbrilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized‚Äù‚Äîwas known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places. The Concordia University mathematician is perhaps most famous for his ‚Äúmonstrous moonshine‚Äù conjecture, which was proved in 1992 and established a deep connection between ",
      " and a special function from number theory.",
      "Before his death a few years ago, McKay unearthed lots of other important connections, too, many involving groups. A group is a set of elements combined with a rule for how those elements relate to one another. It can be thought of as a collection of symmetries‚Äîtransformations that leave a shape, a function or some other mathematical object unchanged in specific ways. For all their abstraction, groups are immensely useful, and they play a central role in mathematics.",
      "In 1972, McKay was ",
      "‚Äîgroups that have a finite number of elements. He observed that in many cases, you can deduce important information about a finite group by looking at a very small subset of its elements. In particular, McKay looked at elements that form a special, smaller group‚Äîcalled a Sylow normalizer‚Äîinside the original group.",
      "Imagine you have a group with 72 elements. This alone doesn‚Äôt tell you much: There are ",
      " of that size. But 72 can also be written as a product of prime numbers, 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 3‚Äîthat is, as 2",
      " √ó 3",
      ". (Generally, the more distinct primes you need to describe the size of your group, the more complicated your group is.) You can decompose your group into smaller subgroups based on these primes. In this case, for instance, you could look at subgroups with eight (2",
      ") elements and subgroups with nine (3",
      ") elements. By studying those subgroups, you can learn more about the structure of your overall group‚Äîwhat other building blocks the group is composed of, for instance.",
      "Now take one of those subgroups and add a few particular elements to it to create a special subgroup, the Sylow normalizer. In your 72-element group, you can build a different Sylow normalizer for each eight-element and nine-element subgroup‚Äîthese are the 2-Sylow normalizers and 3-Sylow normalizers, respectively.",
      "Sylow normalizers, like the subgroups they‚Äôre built out of, can tell mathematicians a lot about the original group. But McKay hypothesized that this connection was far stronger than anyone had imagined. It wasn‚Äôt just that a Sylow normalizer could give insights into a finite group‚Äôs overall structure. He asserted that if mathematicians wanted to compute a crucial quantity that would help them characterize their group, they‚Äôd just have to look at one of a particular set of Sylow normalizers: The Sylow normalizer would be characterized by the exact same number.",
      "This quantity counts the number of ‚Äúrepresentations‚Äù of a certain type‚Äîways you can rewrite elements of the group using arrays of numbers called matrices. Such a tally might seem arbitrary, but it gives mathematicians a sense of how the group‚Äôs elements relate to each other, and it is involved in calculations of other important properties.",
      "There seemed to be no good reason why McKay‚Äôs quantity should always be the same for a finite group and its Sylow normalizers. A Sylow normalizer might contain just a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the number of elements in the larger group. Moreover, the Sylow normalizer often has a very different structure.",
      "It would be as if ‚Äúin every US election, you count the votes in general, and in this little town in Montana, they are exactly the same proportionally,‚Äù said ",
      " of the University of Valencia. ‚ÄúNot similar, not more or less. Exactly the same.‚Äù",
      "But that‚Äôs what McKay conjectured‚Äîfor all finite groups. If true, it would make mathematicians‚Äô lives much easier: Sylow normalizers are much easier to work with than their parent groups. It would also hint at the presence of a deeper mathematical truth, one that mathematicians don‚Äôt yet have a handle on.",
      "A year after McKay first observed the coincidence, a mathematician named ",
      " proved that it held for ",
      ". But then mathematicians got stuck. They were able to show that it held up for one specific group or another, but there were still infinitely many groups left to tackle.",
      "Proving the full conjecture seemed prohibitively difficult. As it turned out, the next major advance on the problem would require the completion of one of the most herculean mathematical projects in history.",
      "The project‚Äîan effort to classify all the building blocks of finite groups‚Äîultimately required thousands of proofs and took more than 100 years to complete. But in 2004, mathematicians finally succeeded in showing that all the building blocks must fall into one of three categories, or else belong to a list of 26 outliers.",
      "‚ÄúI wanted there to be parades. Years of hard, hard, hard work, and she did it, they did it.‚Äù",
      "Mathematicians had long suspected that, once complete, this classification would help simplify problems such as the McKay conjecture. Maybe they didn‚Äôt have to prove the conjecture for all finite groups. Maybe they only had to prove an alternative statement covering the 29 types of building blocks‚Äîor for some related set of straightforward groups‚Äîthat would automatically imply the full McKay conjecture.",
      "But first, someone had to show that this strategy would actually work. The very year that the classification was officially completed, Isaacs, Navarro, and Gunter Malle ",
      " the right way to reframe the McKay conjecture so that they only had to focus on a narrow set of groups.",
      "For each group in this new set, they‚Äôd have to show something a bit stronger than what McKay had proposed: Not only would the number of representations have to be the same for both the group and the Sylow normalizer, but those representations would have to relate to each other according to certain rules. Isaacs, Navarro, and Malle showed that if this stronger statement held for these particular groups, then the McKay conjecture had to be true for every finite group. (‚ÄúThis was during the Euro 2004,‚Äù Navarro recalled. His coauthors ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know that I was sneaking off sometimes to see some games. But important things are important things.‚Äù)",
      "Gabriel Navarro and two colleagues turned one of group theory‚Äôs biggest open conjectures into a tractable problem.",
      "The trio‚Äôs reformulation of the problem was a major breakthrough. Within a few years, mathematicians had used it to resolve most cases of the McKay conjecture. Moreover, it helped them simplify related questions that also involved using one part of an object to study the whole. ‚ÄúTons and tons of conjectures have now been reduced using this as a blueprint,‚Äù said ",
      ", a mathematician at the University of Denver.",
      "But there was one class of groups‚Äî‚Äúgroups of Lie type‚Äù‚Äîfor which the new version of the McKay conjecture remained open. The representations of these groups were particularly difficult to study, and it was challenging to prove that the relationships among them satisfied the conditions that Isaacs, Navarro, and Malle had outlined.",
      "But one of Malle‚Äôs graduate students was on the case. Britta Sp√§th.",
      "In 2003, Sp√§th arrived at the University of Kassel to start her doctorate with Malle. She was almost perfectly suited for working on the McKay conjecture: Even in high school, she could spend days or weeks on a single problem. She particularly reveled in ones that tested her endurance, and she fondly recalls long hours spent searching for ‚Äútricks that are, in a way, not even so deep.‚Äù",
      "Sp√§th spent her time studying group representations as deeply as she could. After she completed her graduate degree, she decided to use that expertise to continue chipping away at the McKay conjecture. ‚ÄúShe has this crazy, really good intuition,‚Äù said Schaeffer Fry, her friend and collaborator. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs able to see it‚Äôs going to be like this.‚Äù",
      "A few years later, in 2010, Sp√§th started working at Paris Cit√© University, where she met Cabanes. He was an expert in the narrower set of groups at the center of the reformulated version of the McKay conjecture, and Sp√§th often went to his office to ask him questions. Cabanes was ‚Äúalways protesting, ‚ÄòThose groups are complicated, my God,‚Äô‚Äù he recalled. Despite his initial hesitancy, he too eventually grew enamored with the problem. It became ‚Äúour obsession,‚Äù he said.",
      "There are four categories of Lie-type groups. Together, Sp√§th and Cabanes started proving the conjecture for each of those categories, and they ",
      " ",
      " over the next decade.",
      "Their work led them to develop a deep understanding of groups of Lie type. Although these groups are the most common building blocks of other groups, and therefore of great mathematical interest, their representations are incredibly difficult to study. Cabanes and Sp√§th often had to rely on opaque theories from disparate areas of math. But in digging those theories up, they provided some of the best characterizations yet of these important groups.",
      "As they did so, they started dating and went on to have two children. (They eventually settled down together in Germany, where they enjoy working together at one of the three whiteboards in their home.)",
      "By 2018, they had just one category of Lie-type groups left. Once that was done, they would have proved the McKay conjecture.",
      "That final case took them six more years.",
      "The fourth kind of Lie group ‚Äúhad so many difficulties, so many bad surprises,‚Äù Sp√§th said. (It didn‚Äôt help that in 2020, the pandemic kept their two young children home from school, making it difficult for them to work.) But gradually, she and Cabanes managed to show that the number of representations for these groups matched those of their Sylow normalizers‚Äîand that the way the representations matched up satisfied the necessary rules. The last case was done. It followed automatically that the McKay conjecture was true.",
      "In October 2023, they finally felt confident enough in their proof to announce it to a room of more than 100 mathematicians. A year later, they ",
      " for the rest of the community to digest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an absolutely spectacular achievement,‚Äù said ",
      " of the University of Manchester.",
      "Mathematicians can now confidently study important properties of groups by looking at their Sylow normalizers alone‚Äîa much easier approach to making sense of these abstract entities, and one that might have practical applications. And in the process of establishing this connection, Navarro said, the researchers developed ‚Äúbeautiful, wonderful, deep mathematics.‚Äù",
      "Other mathematicians now hope to explore the even deeper conceptual reason why the strange coincidence McKay uncovered is true. Although Sp√§th and Cabanes have proved it, mathematicians still don‚Äôt understand why a comparatively tiny set is enough to tell you so much about its larger parent group.",
      "‚ÄúThere has to be some structural reason why these numbers are the same,‚Äù Kessar said.",

Granted, those hints were still below the necessary threshold to claim discovery and hence fell under the rubric of ‚Äúhuge, if true.‚Äù",
      "But now we have more data from DESI, combined with other datasets, and those hints have gotten significantly stronger‚Äîso much so that Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas, who co-chairs one of the DESI working groups, ",

      ") Quantum physics holds that even the emptiest vacuum is teeming with energy in the form of ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù particles that wink in and out of existence, flying apart and coming together in an intricate quantum dance. This roiling sea of virtual particles could give rise to dark energy, giving the universe a little extra push so that it can continue accelerating. The problem is that the quantum vacuum contains too ",
      " energy: roughly 10",
      " times too much.",
      "So the universe should be accelerating much faster than it is if the dark energy is, essentially, the cosmological constant. Still, all the observations to date indicate that it‚Äôs constant. The best theoretical fit thus far is known as the ",
      ", which incorporates both a weakly interacting cold dark matter and dark energy. One alternative theory proposes that the universe may be filled with a fluctuating form of dark energy dubbed ‚Äú",
      ".‚Äù There are also several other alternative models that assume the density of dark energy has varied over the history of the universe.",
      "In its earliest days, the universe was a hot, dense soup of subatomic particles, including hydrogen and helium nuclei, aka baryons. Tiny fluctuations created a rippling pattern through that early ionized plasma, which froze into a three-dimensional place as the universe expanded and cooled. Those ripples, or bubbles, are known as ",
      " (BAO). It‚Äôs possible to use BAOs as a kind of cosmic ruler to investigate the effects of dark energy over the history of the universe.",
      "That‚Äôs what DESI was designed to do: take precise measurements of the apparent size of these bubbles (both near and far) by determining the distances to galaxies and quasars over 11 billion years. That data can then be sliced into chunks to determine how fast the universe was expanding at each point of time in the past, the better to model how dark energy was affecting that expansion.",
      "Last year‚Äôs results were based on analysis of a full year‚Äôs worth of data taken from seven different slices of cosmic time and include 450,000 quasars, the largest ever collected, with a record-setting precision of the most distant epoch (between 8 to 11 billion years back) of 0.82 percent. While there was basic agreement with the Lamba CDM model, when those first-year results were combined with data from other studies (involving the cosmic microwave background radiation and Type Ia supernovae), some subtle differences cropped up.",
      "Essentially, those differences suggested that the dark energy might be getting weaker. In terms of confidence, the results amounted to a 2.6-sigma level for the DESI‚Äôs data combined with CMB datasets. When adding the supernovae data, those numbers grew to 2.5-sigma, 3.5-sigma, or 3.9-sigma levels, depending on which particular supernova dataset was used.",
      "It's important to combine the DESI data with other independent measurements because ‚Äúwe want consistency,‚Äù said DESI co-spokesperson Will Percival of the University of Waterloo. ‚ÄúAll of the different experiments should give us the same answer to how much matter there is in the universe at present day, how fast the universe is expanding. It‚Äôs no good if all the experiments agree with the Lambda-CDM model, but then give you different parameters. That just doesn't work. Just saying it‚Äôs consistent to the Lambda-CDM, that‚Äôs not enough in itself. It has to be consistent with Lambda-CDM and give you the same parameters for the basic properties of that model.‚Äù",
      "These latest results cover the first three years of collected data, spanning almost 15 million galaxies and quasars. Once again, the DESI data alone was consistent with Lambda CDM, i.e., the dark energy is constant. And once again, when combined with other datasets‚Äîfrom CMB, supernovae, and weak gravitational lensing studies‚Äîstrong hints emerged that dark energy might be changing over time. The confidence level ranges from 2.8 to 4.2 sigma, depending on the combination of datasets‚Äîjust shy of the five-sigma threshold.",
      "This might strike the average citizen as an incremental advance, but the reality is more complicated. ‚ÄúThe DESI data itself is not incremental,‚Äù said Percival. ‚ÄúWe now have three years of data rather than one year of data. That is substantial, not just because of an increased area but because we‚Äôve increased the overlap. The way we do the survey is we build up plates on the sky, and, after three years rather than one year of operations, we have a lot more of those overlaps filled in. So our data is a lot more complete in the sense that we‚Äôve gone down to the full depth that we expect to get to in more patches. Consequently, our BAO measurements themselves are a lot better. They‚Äôre between a factor of two and three better depending on exactly this balance between area versus depth.‚Äù",
      "Catherine Heymans, astronomer royal of Scotland, told Ars that these new results give scientists much more confidence in DESI‚Äôs analysis. She was surprised at the excitement over last year's first results, since, ‚Äúwhenever there‚Äôs a first data release, the scientific community always takes the results with a pinch of salt,‚Äù she said. But DESI made its data public, and other scientists have been making their own analyses over the last year; it has stood up to that close scrutiny.",
      "‚ÄúThe really strong significance for dynamical dark energy comes from the combination of the DESI standard ruler, the BAO plus the supernova data,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs two different ways of measuring the expansion rate of the universe. By combining those two things together, you get this strong detection of dynamical dark energy.‚Äù",
      "The next step for the DESI collaboration is to analyze five years‚Äô worth of data to see if the upward trend toward the 5-sigma threshold for discovery holds‚Äîperhaps even surpassing that threshold, which would be very exciting indeed. That will likely not happen for another two years, per Percival. Should 5 sigma be reached, Heymans said astronomers should expect to see similar results in data from the Euclid Space Telescope, which is slated to do a similar experiment to DESI, at higher redshift, in the near future.",
      "‚ÄúIt opens up a huge range of possibilities,‚Äù said Percival of the implications should it be confirmed that dark energy changes over time. ‚ÄúIt will keep theorists happy for many years to come. As a scientist you want to sit a little bit on the fence. But if this is right, this is the next step after the discovery of dark energy. Lambda works. Now, Lambda doesn‚Äôt work. It means there‚Äôs a lot more information that‚Äôs accessible about this process. I think people were worried that everything would show that it just exactly agrees with Lambda. But if there‚Äôs actually things happening to how the acceleration is changing within detail, that‚Äôs exciting because we can get a handle on the physics.‚Äù",
      "‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no fundamental underpinning for what could be causing that dynamical dark energy, and that does make me anxious,‚Äù said Heymans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the observers are throwing the gauntlet back to the theorists. It‚Äôd be nice to be able to explain two dark entities with one fell swoop. I am excited about cracks in the cosmological model, because this way is pushing the theoretical community to think outside the box, to think of new ideas. And maybe that will solve the whole dark entity conundrum, which is why we‚Äôre all here.‚Äù",

After one news conference was canceled last month, two key NASA officials were finally made available on a media teleconference on Friday evening.

The pair is now likely to return home to Earth as part of the Crew 9 mission later this month, about a week after the launch of a new group of astronauts to the space station. This Crew 10 mission has a launch date of March 12, so Wilmore and Williams could finally fly home about two weeks from now.",
      "Let's examine each of Musk's claims in light of what Bowersox and Stich said Friday evening.",
      "On July 14, last year, NASA awarded SpaceX ",
      " various options to bring Wilmore and Williams home on a Crew Dragon vehicle. At the time, the space agency was considering options if Starliner was determined to be unsafe. Among the options NASA was considering were to fly Wilmore and Williams home on the Crew 8 vehicle attached to the station (which would put an unprecedented six people in the capsule) or asking SpaceX to autonomously fly a Dragon to the station to return Wilmore and Williams separately.",
      "\"The SpaceX folks helped us with a lot of options for how we would bring Butch and Suni home on Dragon in a contingency,\" Bowersox said during Friday's teleconference. \"When it comes to adding on missions, or bringing a capsule home early, those were always options. But we ruled them out pretty quickly just based on how much money we've got in our budget, and the importance of keeping crews on the International Space Station. They're an important part of maintaining the station.\"",
      "As a result, the Crew 9 mission launched in September with just two astronauts. Wilmore and Williams joined that crew for a full six-month increment on the space station.",
      "Stich said NASA made that decision based on flight schedules to the space station and the orbiting laboratory's needs. It also allowed time to send SpaceX spacesuits up for the pair of astronauts and to produce seat liners that would make their landing in the water, under parachutes, safe.",
      "\"When we laid all that out, the best option was really the one that we're embarking upon now,\" Stich said. ‚ÄúAnd so we did Crew 9, flying the two empty seats, flying a suit for Butch up, and also making sure that the seats were right for Butch‚Äôs anthropometrics, and Suni's, to return them safely.‚Äù",
      "So yes, SpaceX has been working with NASA to present options, including the possibility of a return last fall. However, those discussions were being held within the program levels and their leaders: Stich for Commercial Crew and Dana Weigel for the International Space Station.",
      "\"Dana and I worked to come up with a decision that worked for the Commercial Crew Program and Space Station,\" Stich said. \"And then, Ken (Bowersox), we all, we had the Flight Readiness Review process with you, and the administrator of NASA listened in as well. So we had a recommendation to the agency and that was on the process that we typically use.\"",
      "Bowersox confirmed that the decision was made at the programmatic level.",
      "\"That‚Äôs typically the way our decisions work,\" Bowersox said. \"The programs work with what makes the most sense for them, programmatically, technically. We‚Äôll weigh in at the headquarters level, and in this case we thought the plan that we came up with made a lot of sense.\"",
      "During the teleconference, a vice president at SpaceX, Bill Gerstenmaier, was asked directly what offer Musk was referring to when he mentioned the Biden administration. He did not provide a substantive answer.",
      "Musk claims he made an offer directly to senior officials in the Biden administration. We have no way to verify that, but it does seem clear that the Biden administration never communicated such an offer to lower-level officials within NASA, who made their decision for technical rather than political reasons.",
      "\"I think you know we work for NASA, and we worked with NASA cooperatively to do whatever we think was the right thing,\" the SpaceX official, Gerstenmaier, replied. \"You know, we were willing to support in any manner they thought was the right way to support. They came up with the option you heard described today by them, and we‚Äôre supporting that option.\"",

      " on December 17 that the return of the crew was delayed into late March or early April.",
      "Then, on February 11, NASA announced that the Crew 10 launch was being brought forward to March 12. This was a couple of weeks earlier than planned, and it was possible because NASA and SpaceX decided to swap out Dragon capsules, using a previously flown vehicle‚ÄîCrew Dragon ",

Asked if political pressure was a reason, Stich said it was not. \"It really was driven by a lot of other factors, and we were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk,\" he said.",
      "Bowersox added that this was correct but also said that NASA appreciated the president's interest in the space program.",
      "\"I can verify that Steve has been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA, but the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation,\" Bowersox said.",

      "The world of mathematics is full of unreachable corners, where unsolvable problems live. Now, yet another has been exposed.",
      "In 1900, the eminent mathematician David Hilbert announced a list of 23 key problems to guide the next century of mathematical research. His problems not only provided a road map for the field but reflected a more ambitious vision‚Äîto build a firm foundation from which all mathematical truths could be derived.",
      "A key part of this vision was that mathematics should be ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù That is, all its statements should be provably true or false.",
      "In the 1930s, Kurt G√∂del demonstrated that this is impossible: In any mathematical system, there are statements that can be neither proved nor disproved. A few years later, Alan Turing and others built on his work, showing that mathematics is riddled with ‚Äúundecidable‚Äù statements‚Äîproblems that cannot be solved by any computer algorithm.",
      "These results demonstrated that there are fundamental limits to what proof and computation are capable of. Some mathematics can simply never be known.",
      "Hilbert‚Äôs dream was dead. But it lived on in fragments. Many of the questions from his turn-of-the-century list still evoked his vision, allowing the idea of a complete mathematics to survive in narrower contexts.",
      "Chief among them was his 10th problem. It concerns Diophantine equations: polynomials with integer coefficients, such as ",
      " + ",
      " = 5.¬† These familiar equations are one of the most central objects of study in mathematics. For millennia, mathematicians have sought integer solutions to them. In this example, for instance, one solution is ",
      " = 1, ",
      " = 2 (since 1",
      " + 2",
      "= 5). Another is ",
      " = 2, ",
      " = ‚àí1.",
      "In 1900, David Hilbert posed 23 problems that he hoped would guide the next century of mathematical research. Those problems still influence the field today.",
      "Other Diophantine equations, such as ",
      " + y",
      " = 3, don‚Äôt have any integer solutions. Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem asked whether it‚Äôs always possible to tell if a given Diophantine equation has integer solutions. Does an algorithm exist to determine this for every equation, or is the problem undecidable? There might be no hope for a complete and systematic approach to all of mathematics‚Äîor even all 23 of Hilbert‚Äôs problems‚Äîbut one might still exist when it comes to Diophantine equations, forming a microcosm of his original program. ‚ÄúThis problem is a very natural version of that dream,‚Äù said ",
      " of Utrecht University.",
      "In 1970, a Russian mathematician named ",
      " shattered this dream. He showed that there is no general algorithm that can determine whether any given Diophantine equation has integer solutions‚Äîthat Hilbert‚Äôs 10th is an undecidable problem. You might be able to come up with an algorithm that can assess most equations, but it won‚Äôt work for every single one.",
      "In even this most straightforward kind of math, unknowability lurks.",
      "The mathematician Yuri Matiyasevich, seen here in 1969, proved that Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem is undecidable.",
      "Mathematicians wanted to test the reach of Matiyasevich‚Äôs conclusion. Say you allow your Diophantine equations to have complex solutions (numbers that can be written with real and imaginary parts, and that aren‚Äôt limited to integers). In this case, every Diophantine equation has a solution, and the answer to Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem is a resounding yes. But there‚Äôs a whole range of Diophantine equations between ones with solutions that must be integers and ones with solutions that can be complex.",
      "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unsolvable for integers, then when you pass to much larger systems of numbers, you get solvability all of a sudden,‚Äù said ",
      " of Harvard University. ‚ÄúWhere is the cutoff?‚Äù",
      "In the 50 years since Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem was resolved, mathematicians have been searching for this cutoff. Now, Koymans and his longtime collaborator, ",
      " of Concordia University in Montreal‚Äîas well as another team of researchers working independently‚Äîhave taken a major step toward that goal. Both groups have proved that, for ",
      " beyond integers, there is ",
      " to determine if any given Diophantine equation has a solution. The work not only allows mathematicians to get a more precise view of what they can and cannot know but gives them an entirely new level of control over one of the most central objects in mathematics.",
      "The new proofs focused on a natural extension of Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem. The extension deals with Diophantine equations whose solutions belong to number systems that are close relatives of the integers.",
      "If you start with the numbers 1 and ‚àí1, you can add them in different combinations to get every other integer. But say you start with a different finite set of numbers‚Äîlike 1, ‚àí1 and ‚àö2. You can add those numbers in different combinations to get a new number system, called a ring of integers (so named even though the ring need not contain only integers). Other rings of integers can be built out of sets of numbers that include, say, the square root of ‚àí1 (the imaginary number that mathematicians call ",
      ")",
      " or the cube root of 2. Is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a given Diophantine equation has solutions that fall in one of these rings of integers?",
      "Carlo Pagano of Concordia University recently used his expertise on elliptic curves to resolve a major conjecture in number theory.",
      "Mathematicians suspected that, for every single ring of integers‚Äîthat is, infinitely many systems of numbers‚Äîthe problem is still undecidable. This would extend the conclusion well beyond the initial, integer-focused scope of Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem.",
      "To prove this, they hoped to follow in the footsteps of the proof of that original problem‚Äîthe one involving only integer solutions.",
      "In general, undecidability proofs‚Äîproofs that determine whether there is a general algorithm that can answer a given question‚Äîfollow the same recipe: They show that the problem of interest is equivalent to a famous undecidable problem in computer science called the halting problem. The halting problem asks whether an idealized computational device called a Turing machine, when fed a given input, will run forever or eventually halt. It‚Äôs known that there‚Äôs no algorithm that can answer this for every Turing machine.",
      "It‚Äôs possible to think of Diophantine equations as computational devices, too. Consider the equation ",
      " = ",
      ". It has infinitely many integer solutions. If you plug in different integers for ",
      " and solve for ",
      ", the values you get all belong to a famous set of integers: the perfect squares. It is easy to imagine a computer program (that is, a Turing machine) that performs an equivalent task: ‚ÄúCompute the sequence of perfect squares.‚Äù",
      "Other Diophantine equations can encode other kinds of computations.",
      "Julia Robinson played a key role in the eventual proof of Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem. ‚ÄúShe made one of the fundamental breakthroughs in the history of mathematics,‚Äù said the mathematician Andrew Granville. Yet ‚Äúsomehow, the people that gave out prizes didn‚Äôt give her many.‚Äù",
      "To settle Hilbert‚Äôs original 10th problem, mathematicians built on this idea. In work that began with Julia Robinson and others around 1950 and culminated in Matiyasevich‚Äôs 1970 result, it was shown that for every Turing machine, there is a corresponding Diophantine equation. ‚ÄúIt was completely unexpected,‚Äù said ",
      " of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. ‚ÄúDiophantine equations over the integers are enough to define, basically, anything you can imagine.‚Äù",
      "Moreover, the mathematicians set up this elegant correspondence so that if a Turing machine halted for a given input, its corresponding Diophantine equation would have an integer solution. If the Turing machine ran forever, its corresponding Diophantine equation would have no solution. But this meant that Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem encoded the halting problem: An algorithm that could sort Diophantine equations based on whether or not they had integer solutions would also be able to sort Turing machines based on whether or not they halted.",
      "In other words, Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem is undecidable.",
      "Mathematicians hoped to follow the same approach to prove the extended, rings-of-integers version of the problem‚Äîbut they hit a snag.",
      "The useful correspondence between Turing machines and Diophantine equations falls apart when the equations are allowed to have non-integer solutions. For instance, consider again the equation ",
      " = ",
      ". If you‚Äôre working in a ring of integers that includes ‚àö2, then you‚Äôll end up with some new solutions, such as ",
      " = ‚àö2, ",
      " = 2. The equation no longer corresponds to a Turing machine that computes perfect squares‚Äîand, more generally, the Diophantine equations can no longer encode the halting problem.",
      "But in 1988, a graduate student at New York University named ",
      " started to play with ideas for how to get around this problem. By 2000, she and others had formulated a plan. Say you were to add a bunch of extra terms to an equation like ",
      " = ",
      " that magically forced ",
      " to be an integer again, even in a different number system. Then you could salvage the correspondence to a Turing machine. Could the same be done for all Diophantine equations? If so, it would mean that Hilbert‚Äôs problem could encode the halting problem in the new number system.",
      "Over the years, Shlapentokh and other mathematicians figured out what terms they had to add to the Diophantine equations for various kinds of rings, which allowed them to demonstrate that Hilbert‚Äôs problem was still undecidable in those settings. They then boiled down all remaining rings of integers to one case: rings that involve the imaginary number ",
      ". Mathematicians realized that in this case, the terms they‚Äôd have to add could be determined using a special equation called an elliptic curve.",
      "But the elliptic curve would have to satisfy two properties. First, it would need to have infinitely many solutions. Second, if you switched to a different ring of integers‚Äîif you removed the imaginary number from your number system‚Äîthen all the solutions to the elliptic curve would have to maintain the same underlying structure.",
      "As it turned out, building such an elliptic curve that worked for every remaining ring was an extremely subtle and difficult task. But Koymans and Pagano‚Äîexperts on elliptic curves who had worked closely together since they were in graduate school‚Äîhad just the right tool set to try.",
      "Since his time as an undergraduate, Koymans had been thinking about Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem. Throughout graduate school, and throughout his collaboration with Pagano, it beckoned. ‚ÄúI spent a few days every year thinking about it and getting horribly stuck,‚Äù Koymans said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd try three things and they‚Äôd all blow up in my face.‚Äù",
      "In 2022, while at a conference in Banff, Canada, he and Pagano ended up chatting about the problem. They hoped that together, they could build the special elliptic curve needed to resolve the problem. After finishing some other projects, they got to work.",
      "Peter Koymans, a mathematician at Utrecht University, has been thinking about Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem since he was an undergraduate.",
      "They started with a simple equation for an elliptic curve that didn‚Äôt satisfy either of the required properties. They knew they could use a well-established technique called a quadratic twist‚Äîsomething they‚Äôd been studying for the better part of a decade‚Äîto tweak the equation so that it would meet the first condition. They simply had to multiply one of the equation‚Äôs variables by a specific number, and they‚Äôd get a new elliptic curve with infinitely many solutions.",
      "But this left them with a problem. They had no way to guarantee that this new curve satisfied the second property‚Äîthat its solutions would look similar for rings that differed by an imaginary number. The mathematicians needed to get better control over the quadratic twist.",
      "They got stuck. ‚ÄúI had this dark feeling,‚Äù Koymans said. ‚ÄúI started to get suspicious that we were missing something.‚Äù",
      "Then, in summer 2024, while working on a different problem, the pair had to use quadratic twists again. One night, in the middle of this research, Koymans found himself lying awake, unable to stop thinking about Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem.",
      "That other work, Koymans realized, gave them an important hint, one of those strange and surprising mathematical concordances that sometimes appear: If the number they used in the quadratic twist was the product of exactly three prime numbers, then they‚Äôd get the control they needed to guarantee the second property. But because their elliptic curve had to be constructed so carefully and meet so many specifications, there were lots of additional constraints on what those three primes could be. Could Koymans and Pagano find ones that worked‚Äîno matter which ring they were using?",
      "Pagano happened to have planned a visit to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, where Koymans was working at the time, a few days later. They spent the next week struggling at the blackboard together, trying to find primes that would meet all the constraints. Finally, they figured out that they had to use four primes, rather than three, to construct their quadratic twist. This allowed them to apply a method from an entirely separate area of math, called additive combinatorics, to ensure that the right combination of primes existed for every ring.",
      "That was the final piece: They‚Äôd built their elliptic curve. It gave them the recipe they needed to add terms to their Diophantine equations, which then enabled them to encode Turing machines‚Äîand the halting problem‚Äîin those equations, regardless of what number system they used. It was settled. Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem is undecidable for every ring of integers.",
      "The result was solidified further last Thursday, when, less than two months after Koymans and Pagano posted their paper online, an independent team of four mathematicians announced a ",
      ". Instead of looking for a special elliptic curve, they had relied on a different kind of equation to do the same job.",
      "Both groups hope to use their techniques‚Äîwhich give them unprecedented control over elliptic curves and related equations‚Äîto make progress on other problems as well. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a possibility that the two methods could be used together to do even more,‚Äù said ",
      ", a mathematician at Princeton University and one of the authors of the second proof.",
      "Meanwhile, the search for where undecidability ends and decidability begins is not over: Mathematicians are continuing to explore Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem in new settings.",
      "This is just one of many questions, according to ",
      " of the University of Montreal, that ‚Äúreflect the philosophical side of what in the world is true.‚Äù",
      "All knowledge has limits. ‚ÄúIt reminds us there are things that are just not doable,‚Äù Granville said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who you are or what you are.‚Äù",

      " for the Japanese edition of WIRED, scheduled to be released in April 2025. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.",
      ": Information is not the same as truth. Most information is not an accurate representation of reality. The main role information plays is to connect many things, to connect people. Sometimes people are connected by truth, but often it is easier to use fiction or illusion.",
      "The same is true of the natural world. Most of the information that exists in nature is not meant to tell the truth. We are told that the basic information underlying life is DNA, but is DNA true? No. DNA connects many cells together to make a body, but it does not tell us the truth about anything. Similarly, the Bible, one of the most important texts in human history, has connected millions of people together, but not necessarily by telling them the truth.",
      "When information is in a complete free market, the vast majority of information becomes fiction, illusion, or lies. This is because there are three main difficulties with truth.",
      "First of all, telling the truth is costly. On the other hand, creating fiction is inexpensive. If you want to write a truthful account of history, economics, physics, et cetera, you need to invest time, effort, and money in gathering evidence and fact-checking. With fiction, however, you can simply write whatever you want.",
      "Second, truth is often complex, because reality itself is complex. Fiction, on the other hand, can be as simple as you want it to be.",
      "And finally, truth is often painful and unpleasant. Fiction, on the other hand, can be made as pleasant and appealing as possible.",
      "Thus, in a completely free information market, truth would be overwhelmed and buried by the sheer volume of fiction and illusion. If we want to get to the truth, we must make a special effort to repeatedly try to uncover the facts. This is exactly what has happened with the spread of the internet. The internet was a completely free marketplace of information. Therefore, the expectation that the internet would spread facts and truths, and spread understanding and consensus among people, quickly proved to be naive.",
      "Yuval Noah Harari is a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Survival Risk at the University of Cambridge.",
      "There are many things we can learn from history. First, knowing history helps us understand what new things AI has brought. Without knowing the history, we cannot properly understand the novelty of the current situation. And the most important point about AI is that it is an agent, not just a tool.",
      "Some people often equate the AI revolution with the printing revolution, the invention of the written word, or the emergence of mass media such as radio and television, but this is a misunderstanding. All previous information technologies were mere tools in the hands of humans. Even when the printing press was invented, it was still humans who wrote the text and decided which books to print. The printing press itself cannot write anything, nor can it choose which books to print.",
      "AI, however, is fundamentally different: It is an agent; it can write its own books and decide which ideas to disseminate. It can even create entirely new ideas on its own, something that has never been done before in history. We humans have never faced a superintelligent agent before.",
      "Of course, there have been actors in the past. Animals are one example. However, humans are more intelligent than animals, especially in the area of connection, in which they are overwhelmingly superior. In fact, the greatest strength of ",
      " is not its individual capabilities. On an individual level, I am not stronger than a chimpanzee, an elephant, or a lion. If a small group, say 10 humans and 10 chimpanzees, were to fight, the chimpanzees would probably win.",
      "So why do humans dominate the planet? It is because humans can create networks of thousands, millions, and even billions of people who do not know each other personally but can cooperate effectively on a huge scale. Ten chimpanzees can cooperate closely with each other, but 1,000 chimpanzees cannot. Humans, on the other hand, can cooperate not with 1,000 individuals, but with a million or even a hundred million.",
      "The reason why human beings are able to cooperate on such a large scale is because we can create and share stories. All large-scale cooperation is based on a common story. Religion is the most obvious example, but financial and economic stories are also good examples. Money is perhaps the most successful story in history. Money is just a story. The bills and coins themselves have no objective value, but we believe in the same story about money that connects us and allows us to cooperate. This ability has given humans an advantage over chimpanzees, horses, and elephants. These animals cannot create a story like money.",
      "But AI can. For the first time in history, we share the planet with beings that can create and network stories better than we can. The biggest question facing humanity today is: How do we share the planet with this new superintelligence?",
      "I think the basic attitude toward the AI revolution is to avoid extremes. At one end of the spectrum is the fear that AI will come along and destroy us all, and at the other end is optimism that AI will improve health care, improve education, and create a better world.",
      "What we need is a middle path. First and foremost, we need to understand the scale of this change. Compared to the AI revolution we are facing now, all previous revolutions in history will pale in comparison. This is because throughout history, when humans invented something, it was always they who made the decisions about how to use it to create a new society, a new economic system, or a new political system.",
      "Consider, for example, the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. At that time, people invented steam engines, railroads, and steamships. Although this revolution transformed the productive capacity of economies, military capabilities, and geopolitical situations, and brought about major changes throughout the world, it was ultimately people who decided how to create industrial societies.",
      "As a concrete example, in the 1850s, the US commodore Matthew C. Perry came to Japan on a steamship and forced Japan to accept US trade terms. As a result, Japan decided: Let‚Äôs industrialize like the US. At that time, there was a big debate in Japan over whether to industrialize or not, but the debate was only between people. The steam engine itself did not make any decision.",
      "This time, however, in building a new society based on AI, humans are not the only ones making decisions. AI itself may have the power to come up with new ideas and make decisions.",
      "What if AI had its own money, made its own decisions about how to spend it, and even started investing it in the stock market? In that scenario, to understand what is happening in the financial system, we would need to understand not only what humans are thinking, but also what AI is thinking. Furthermore, AI has the potential to generate ideas that are completely incomprehensible to us.",
      "That depends on how you define singularity. As I understand it, singularity is the point at which we no longer understand what is happening out there. It is the point at which our imagination and understanding cannot keep up. And we may be very close to that point.",
      "Even without a quantum computer or fully-fledged artificial general intelligence‚Äîthat is, AI that can ",
      "‚Äîthe level of AI that exists today may be enough to cause it. People often think of the AI revolution in terms of one giant AI coming along and creating new inventions and changes, but we should rather think in terms of networks. What would happen if millions or tens of millions of advanced AIs were networked together to bring about major changes in economics, military, culture, and politics? The network will create a completely different world that we will never understand. For me, singularity is precisely that point‚Äîthe point at which our ability to understand the world, and even our own lives, will be overwhelmed.",
      "If you ask me if I am for or against singularity, first and foremost I would say that I am just trying to get a clear understanding of what is going on right now. People often want to immediately judge things as good or bad, but the first thing to do is to take a closer look at the situation. Looking back over the past 30 years, technology has done some very good things and some very bad things. It has not been a clear-cut ‚Äújust good‚Äù or ‚Äújust bad‚Äù thing. This will probably be the same in the future.",
      "The one obvious difference in the future, however, is that when we no longer understand the world, we will no longer control our future. We will then be in the same position as animals. We will be like the horse or the elephant that does not understand what is happening in the world. Horses and elephants cannot understand that human political and financial systems control their destiny. The same thing can happen to us humans.",
      "We used to understand the world a little better, because it was humans who managed the world, and it was a network of humans. Of course, it was always difficult to understand how the whole network worked, but at least as a human being myself, I could understand kings, emperors, and high priests. They were human beings just like me. When the king made a decision, I could understand it to some extent, because all the members of the information network were human beings. But now that AI is becoming a major member of the information network, it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand the important decisions that shape our world.",
      "Perhaps the most important example is finance. Throughout history, humans have invented increasingly sophisticated financial mechanisms. Money is one such example, as are stocks and bonds. Interest is another financial invention. But what is the purpose of inventing these financial mechanisms? It is not the same as inventing the wheel or the automobile, nor is it the same as developing a new kind of rice that can be eaten.",
      "The purpose of inventing finance, then, is to create trust and connection between people. Money enables cooperation between you and me. You grow rice and I pay you. Then you give me the rice and I can eat it. Even though we do not know each other personally, we both trust money. Good money builds trust between people.",
      "Finance has built a network of trust and cooperation that connects millions of people. And until now, it was still possible for humans to understand this financial network. This is because all financial mechanisms needed to be humanly understandable. It makes no sense to invent a financial mechanism that humans cannot understand, because it cannot create trust.",
      "But AI may invent entirely new financial mechanisms that are far more complex than interest, bonds, or stocks. They will be mathematically extremely complex and incomprehensible to humans. AI itself, on the other hand, can understand them. The result will be a financial network where AIs trust each other and communicate with each other, and humans will not understand what is happening. We will lose control of the financial system at this point, and everything that depends on it.",
      "Ideally, we would trust AI to help us deal with these hyperobjects‚Äîrealities that are so complex that they are beyond our comprehension. But perhaps the biggest question in the development of AI is: How do we make AI, which can be more intelligent than humans, trustworthy? We do not have the answer to that question.",
      "I believe the biggest paradox in the AI revolution is the paradox of trust‚Äîthat is, that we are now rushing to develop superintelligent AI that we do not fully trust. We understand that there are many risks. Rationally, it would be wise to slow down the pace of development, invest more in safety, and create safety mechanisms first to make sure that superintelligent AIs do not escape our control or behave in ways that are harmful to humans.",
      "However, the opposite is actually happening today. We are in the midst of an accelerating AI race. Various companies and nations are racing at breakneck speed to develop more powerful AIs. Meanwhile, little investment has been made to ensure that AI is secure.",
      "Ask the entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and government leaders who are leading this AI revolution, ‚ÄúWhy the rush?‚Äù and nearly all of them answer: ‚ÄúWe know it‚Äôs risky, for sure. We know it‚Äôs dangerous. We understand that it would be wiser to go slower and invest in safety. But we cannot trust our human competitors. If other companies and countries accelerate their development of AI while we are trying to slow it down and make it safer, they will develop superintelligence first and dominate the world. So we have no choice but to move forward as fast as possible to stay ahead of the unreliable competition.‚Äù",
      "But then I asked those responsible for AI a second question: ‚ÄúDo you think we can trust the superintelligence you are developing?‚Äù Their the answer was: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù This is almost insane. People who don‚Äôt even trust other humans somehow think they can trust this alien AI.",
      "We have thousands of years of experience with humans. We understand human psychology and politics. We understand the human desire for power, but we also have some understanding of how to limit that power and build trust among humans. In fact, over the past few thousand years, humans have developed quite a lot of trust. 100,000 years ago, humans lived in small groups of a few dozen people and could not trust outsiders. Today, however, we have huge nations, trade networks that extend around the world, and hundreds of millions, even billions, of people who trust each other to some extent.",
      "We know that AI is a doer, that it makes its own decisions, creates new ideas, sets new goals, creates tricks and lies that humans do not understand, and may pursue alien goals beyond our comprehension. We have many reasons to be suspicious of AI. We have no experience with AI, and we do not know how to trust it.",
      "I think it is a huge mistake for people to assume that they can trust AI when they do not trust each other. The safest way to develop superintelligence is to first strengthen trust between humans, and then cooperate with each other to develop superintelligence in a safe manner. But what we are doing now is exactly the opposite. Instead, all efforts are being directed toward developing a superintelligence.",
      "It depends on the standard of expectations we have. If we look back and compare humanity today to 100,000 years ago, when we were hunter-gatherers living in small herds of a few dozen people, we have built an astonishingly large network of trust. We have a system in which hundreds of millions of people cooperate with each other on a daily basis.",
      "Libertarians often take these mechanisms for granted and refuse to consider where they come from. For example, you have electricity and drinking water in your home. When you go to the bathroom and flush the water, the sewage goes into a huge sewage system. That system is created and maintained by the state. But in the libertarian mindset, it is easy to take for granted that you just use the toilet and flush the water and no one needs to maintain it. But of course, someone needs to.",
      "There really is no such thing as a perfect free market. In addition to competition, there always needs to be some sort of system of trust. Certain things can be successfully created by competition in a free market, however, there are some services and necessities that cannot be sustained by market competition alone. Justice is one example.",
      "Imagine a perfect free market. Suppose I enter into a business contract with you, and I break that contract. So we go to court and ask the judge to make a decision. But what if I had bribed the judge? Suddenly you can‚Äôt trust the free market. You would not tolerate the judge taking the side of the person who paid the most bribes. If justice were to be traded in a completely free market, justice itself would collapse and people would no longer trust each other. The trust to honor contracts and promises would disappear, and there would be no system to enforce them.",
      "Therefore, any competition always requires some structure of trust. In my book, I use the example of the World Cup of soccer. You have teams from different countries competing against each other, but in order for competition to take place, there must first be agreement on a common set of rules. If Japan had its own rules and Germany had another set of rules, there would be no competition. In other words, even competition requires a foundation of common trust and agreement. Otherwise, order itself will collapse.",
      "In social media, for example, fake news, disinformation, and conspiracy theories are deliberately spread to destroy trust among people. But algorithms are not necessarily the spreaders of fake news and conspiracy theories. Many have achieved this simply because they were designed to do so.",
      "The purpose the algorithms of Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok is to maximize user engagement. The easiest way to do this, it was discovered after much trial and error, was to spread information that fueled people‚Äôs anger, hatred, and desire. This is because when people are angry, they are more inclined to pursue the information and spread it to others, resulting in increased engagement.",
      "But what if we gave the algorithm a different purpose? For example, if you give it a purpose such as increasing trust among people or increasing truthfulness, the algorithm will never spread fake news. On the contrary, it will help build a better society, a better democratic society.",
      "Another important point is that democracy should be a dialogue between human beings. In order to have a dialogue, you need to know and trust that you are dealing with a human being. But with social media and the internet, it is increasingly difficult to know whether the information you are reading is really written and disseminated by humans or just bots. This destroys trust between humans and makes democracy very difficult.",
      "To address this, we could have regulations and laws prohibiting bots and AI from pretending to be human. I don‚Äôt think AI itself should be banned at all; AI and bots are welcome to interact with us, but only if they make it clear that they are AI and not human. When we see information on Twitter, we need to know whether it is being spread by a human or a bot.",
      "Some people may say, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a violation of freedom of expression?‚Äù But bots do not have freedom of expression. While I firmly oppose censorship of human expression, this does not protect the expression of bots.",
      "Of course it can happen. On the one hand, AI can be very creative and come up with ideas that we would never have thought of. But at the same time, AI can also manipulate us by feeding us vast amounts of junk and misleading information.",
      "The key point is that we humans are stakeholders in society. As I mentioned earlier with the example of the sewage system, we have a body. If the sewage system collapses, we become sick, spreading diseases such as dysentery and cholera, and in the worst case, we die. But that is not a threat at all to AI, which does not care if the sewage system collapses, because it will not get sick or die. When human citizens debate, for example, whether to allocate money to a government agency to manage a sewage system, there is an obvious vested interest. So while AI can come up with some very novel and imaginative ideas for sewage systems, we must always remember that AI is not human or even organic to begin with.",
      "It is easy to forget that we have bodies, especially when we are discussing cyberspace. What makes AI different from humans is not only that its imagination and way of thinking, which are alien, but also that its body itself is completely different from ours. Ultimately, AI is also a physical being; it does not exist in some purely mental space, but in a network of computers and servers.",
      "I think there are two important issues. One is the issue of trust, which has been the subject of much discussion up to this point. We are now in a situation where trust between human beings is at stake. This is the greatest danger. If we can strengthen trust between humans, we will be better able to cope with the AI revolution.",
      "The second is the threat of being completely manipulated or misdirected by AI. In the early internet days, the primary metaphor for technology was the Web. The World Wide Web was envisioned as a spiderweb-like network connecting people to each other.",
      "Today, however, the primary metaphor is the cocoon. People are increasingly living in individual cocoons of information. People are bombarded with so much information that they are blind to the reality around them. People are trapped in different information cocoons. For the first time in history, a nonhuman entity, an AI, is able to create such a cocoon of information.",
      "Throughout history, people have lived in a human cultural cocoon. Poetry, legends, myths, theater, architecture, tools, cuisine, ideology, money, and all the other cultural products that have shaped our world have all come from the human mind. In the future, however, many of these cultural products will come from nonhuman intelligence. Our poems, videos, ideologies, and money will come from nonhuman intelligence. We may be trapped in such an alien world, out of touch with reality. This is a fear that humans have held deep in their hearts for thousands of years. Now, more than ever, this fear has become real and dangerous.",
      "For example, Buddhism speaks of the concept of mƒÅyƒÅ‚Äîillusion, hallucination. With the advent of AI, it may be even more difficult to escape from this world of illusion than before. AI is capable of flooding us with new illusions, illusions that do not even originate in the human intellect or imagination. We will find it very difficult to even comprehend the illusions.",
      "When a new technology appears, it is not necessarily bad in itself, but people do not yet know how to use it beneficially. The reason why they don‚Äôt know is that we don‚Äôt have a model for it.",
      "When the Industrial Revolution took place in the 19th century, no one had a model for how to build a ‚Äúgood industrial society‚Äù or how to use technologies such as steam engines, railroads, and telegraphs for the benefit of humanity. Therefore, people experimented in various ways. Some of these experiments, such as the creation of modern imperialism and totalitarian states, had disastrous results.",
      "This is not to say that AI itself is bad or harmful. The real problem is that we do not have a historical model for building an AI society. Therefore, we will have to repeat experiments. Moreover, AI itself will now make its own decisions and conduct its own experiments. And some of these experiments may have terrible results.",
      "That is why we need a self-correcting mechanism‚Äîa mechanism that can detect and correct errors before something fatal happens. But this is not something that can be tested in a laboratory before introducing AI technology to the world. It is impossible to simulate history in a laboratory.",
      "For example, let‚Äôs consider the railroad being invented.",
      "In a laboratory, people were able to see if steam engines would explode due to a malfunction. But no one could simulate the changes they would bring to the economic and political situation when the rail network spread out over tens of thousands of kilometers.",
      "The same is true of AI. No matter how many times we experiment with AI in the laboratory, it will be impossible to predict what will happen when millions of superintelligences are unleashed on the real world and begin to change the economic, political, and social landscape. Almost certainly, there will be major mistakes. That is why we should proceed more carefully and more slowly. We must allow ourselves time to adapt, time to discover, and correct our mistakes.",
