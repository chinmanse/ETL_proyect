And then these white girls come along, right? Cameron Adler, ", ", and they\u2019re instant superstars. Everybody\u2019s saying they put the league on the map.\"", "To this, Moore replies, \"And they're getting all the endorsements and sponsorships. Yeah, it's messed up.\"", "Riley replies, \"You gotta admit there's something special about her game, though, right?\"", "\"Yeah, she's white. But I hear you. Cam could play. I had a lot of respect for her,\" says Moore.", "Incidentally, there is a well-known real-life white player named Cameron Brink and a well-known real-life Black player named Maya Moore, though Moore retired in 2023.", "\"Law & Order\" fans were quick to respond on Twitter to express their displeasure with name-dropping Clark, who holds the NCAA scoring record and was named 2024 WNBA Rookie of the Year.", "\"Caitlin Clark is popular because she dominates on the court and shatters records, not because she is white.

Caitlin's privilege helps get other players put on. Case and point: Kate Martin! Her privilege helps get other players endorsement deals. Caitlin said the more we uplift black women, it's going to be a beautiful thing. She wasn't talking to her racist MAGA fans.
